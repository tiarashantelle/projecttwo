<h1>I’m an artistic hippie trying to make a difference in society. </h1>
<p>I’ve always been the type to help people. I even thought about being a psychologist my freshman year of college. I just never could shake the creative gene in me. So I thought, “why not combine both?” Merge the two, my love for helping people with my passion for art, and see what type of career I can have.</p>
<p>It’s everyone’s duty to advocate for the marginalized groups. Therefore, I love creating equality themed projects. These meaningful and rich messages revolve around topics such as:</p>
Women’s rights
Racial equality
LGBTQ
Self love
<p>There’s definitely no turning back! I’m doing this for the audience. The content, the truths within the stories, are all real and relate to many individuals in the world. The work I’ve done and have been a part of includes:</p>
Videos/short films
Short essays
Poetry
Photography 
<p>I hope you’re touched and enlightened while experiencing these works of art. </p>
